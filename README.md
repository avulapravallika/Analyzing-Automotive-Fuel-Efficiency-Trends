# Repository Description: Analyzing Automotive Fuel Efficiency Trends

## Project Overview:
This project analyzes trends in automotive fuel efficiency using the Auto-MPG dataset. The dataset includes attributes such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin for various car models. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that can help anticipate a car's performance and fuel efficiency based on these attributes.

## Key Features:
- Data Acquisition and Cleaning: The project begins with acquiring the Auto-MPG dataset and cleaning it to handle missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are used to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis and linear regression are performed to predict fuel efficiency and understand the impact of different attributes.
- Hypothesis Testing: The project tests hypotheses related to the influence of factors such as cylinders, displacement, and horsepower on fuel efficiency.

## Results and Insights:
- Fuel efficiency is influenced by attributes such as cylinders, displacement, and horsepower.
- Japanese cars tend to have higher fuel efficiency and lower horsepower compared to USA-originated cars.
- The dataset shows an increase in average mpg over the years.
- The linear regression model effectively predicts fuel efficiency, with an R-squared score of 84.16%.

## Lessons Learned:
- Importance of Data Quality: Ensuring data quality is crucial for meaningful analysis.
- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Combining domain knowledge with statistical and programming skills enhances the analysis process.
- Continuous Model Evaluation: Regularly evaluating and refining the regression model is essential for accurate predictions.

## Challenges Faced:
- Data Cleaning Complexity: Dealing with missing values and outliers required careful consideration and multiple iterations.
- Model Complexity: Selecting the right attributes for the regression model posed a challenge, requiring iterative adjustments.

## Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing car fuel efficiency, applicable to both consumers and manufacturers in making informed decisions. The challenges encountered and lessons learned contribute to continuous improvement for future analysis projects.
